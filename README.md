All of the code located in App.js file.

This was created for Fanimal coding assesment. I found and imported the react-dates library for React, which contains everything I needed. I read through their documentation for help and used code snippets from their example code.

To run it you must first:

clone this repo using "git clone https://github.com/AhouraNiknam/fanimal-calendar-app.git"

Then cd into the folder by typing "cd fanimal-calendar-app"

Then type "npm install" to install all the modules and scripts needed to run it

Finally type "npm start" to run the app. This should open up a new window in your browser.
